We are working on the theme of
Event Management. Usually there are a lot of problems while organising a event like finding sponsers, guests, judges, designers, developers
etc. So our website tackles all these issues by providing everything at one place. You can directly choose sponsers, guest, judges for an
event from our list or we can even help you get in touch with the ones not in our list. You can also look up at the previous works of designers,
developers and choose them accordingly. We also provide the oppustunity to create your own new event as well as become a sponsor. 
Ticket booking is also available for events directly from our site. 
We also plan to implement ML so that once an organizer enters an event and some details about it, he can get a complete plan of it based on analyses of previous events. 
We also plan to implement an RFID System which is a SMART attribute for event management. 
It accelerates online registration and onsite check-in process, elevates the data analyses to develop a more targeted event marketing strategy, increase event engagement through solutions for online and offline interaction.
